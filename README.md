# frontend-blog-app
I created a personal blog using HTML, CSS, and PHP. blog have multiple pages, including a home page, a blog page, and a contact page. Here are the requirements for the blog:


Homepage: Created a homepage that displays a header with a logo, navigation menu, and a featured post section with a title, image, and excerpt from the latest blog post. The navigation menu have links to other pages on the website, including the blog page and the contact page.

Blog page: Created a blog page that displays a list of blog posts, with the most recent post at the top. Each blog post have a title, image, excerpt, and a "Read More" button that links to the full post. Include a sidebar with a search bar and a list of categories.

Single post page: Created a single post page that displays the full blog post, including the title, image, content, and author. Include social sharing buttons to allow readers to share the post on social media.

Contact page: Created a contact page with a form that allows users to enter their name, email, subject, and message. When the user submits the form, the data should be sent to a PHP script that will process the data and shows a successful message.

Responsive design: Ensured that the website is responsive and looks good on all devices, including desktop, tablet, and mobile.

This project is going to be in two parts. In this first part, designed all the pages, of the blog website or application and made them responsive. The second part is going to be the backend using PHP & MySQL to make this whole application come to life.
